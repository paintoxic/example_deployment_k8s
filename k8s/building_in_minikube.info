Set docker-env to a minikube k8s cluster

This operation allow build images directly in a context of minikube

eval $(minikube docker-env)

Then build docker images like a locally

docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> <PATH_OF_DOCKERFILE>

In the deployments that use the previously builded image the imagePullPolicy must be set to "Never", so that k8s doesnt try to download the images
